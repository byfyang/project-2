# Project 2: Sinatra Full Stack App - Food Blog

Heroku Hosted URL: https://fooddrinkblog.herokuapp.com/
###Installation instructions:
Copy the heroku hosted url and it'll take you the application site. 


###Technologies Used:
* JQuery/Javascript - used to interact between Javascript and the erb/html form. Specifically used to allow Google Maps API to be utilized
* Sinatra - used as the server-end framework: CRUD and restful Routes
* Ruby - server end code to populate data to the routes
* ERB format to display the web pages


###Approach Taken:

The purpose of this app is to allow a user to document what they ate and some useful additional information about the food item including the location via using google maps. This app has a very specific scope. I originally created this project for my own personal use. 

I approached this app from the server side, in order to insure that I could create, read, update, and delete my data using restful routes. Once that was accomplished, I approached the front end using Materialize CSS to design my front page. I've tried to keep everything to a minimal and simplistic user experience. 


###Unsolved Problems:
  Additional Features I would like to add: 
  * Add google maps to the drink database too
  * add ingredients, so a user can search the food/drink database by food
  * be able to search the food/drink database by location
  * user being able to upload their own photos
  * add search bar
  * additional CSS improvements
