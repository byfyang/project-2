The purpose of this app was to allow a user to remember what they ate and some useful additional information about the food item along with the location of where they used using google maps. The app has a very specific scope. I created this project because whenever I used to go to Taiwan I loved all the food I ate there. However, if someone asked where, what and how I ate them, I would give a limtied answer. In today's age where internet access is everywhere, this will help document my eating adventures. 

I approached this app from the server side, in order to insure that I could create, read, update, and delete my data using restful routes. Once that was accomplished, I approached the front end using Materialize CSS to design my front page. I've tried to keep everything to a minimal and simplistic user experience.
